BUGS, WHY, AND HOW
==========================

- Trying to use the IP API only returns the localhost IP, 127.0.0.1
	- Probably due to fact that we are running on the same server that we connect to
	- Fixed by completely removing the ip.py file and using the Bing maps API

- User rpeci01 is cursed
	- Has errors not experienced by other users
	- Database entries and files are all screwed up
	- FIX: will remove and rebuild the database prior to launch date

- Serbia still exists
